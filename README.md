# Portfolio-Website

Project 2 - Milestone 1: Proposal
Project Title: Creative Interactive Portfolio Website
Overall Description of the Project
Topic / Purpose of the Web App
For my final project, I will create a multi-page portfolio website built with React. The main goal is to create a portfolio website. But the stretch goal is to present my work in a visually dynamic and interactive way, showcasing both my design and technical abilities. This portfolio will include separate pages for my projects.
I want the website to feel modern and good color palette.
Inspiration
My inspiration comes from visually striking portfolio websites that use:
Parallax scrolling

Strong color direction

Minimalist but creative layouts

Examples of my inspiration:

Intended Audience
The intended audience includes:
Recruiters and hiring managers, and basically the job market

Anyone evaluating my skillset in design, UI/UX, or creative technology.
Possible Tools and Technologies
Although I will primarily use React (JSX), I plan to explore:
React Router for multi-page navigation

GSAP (optional) for scroll-trigger animations

Next.js (optional alternative), if I can learn it in time

Figma or hand-drawn wireframes for planning the layout
